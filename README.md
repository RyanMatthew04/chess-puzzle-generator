# Checkmate-in-1 Puzzle Generator
This project aims to create an AI-powered web app that automatically generates unique chess puzzles where the user must find a checkmate in one move.
It leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to produce endless, diverse puzzles for chess players to improve their tactical skills.

## Description
The Checkmate-in-1 Puzzle Generator is designed to assist chess players in honing their checkmate recognition abilities.
By using GANs trained on historical chess positions, the app generates checkmate-in-1 scenarios, ensuring a variety of puzzles each time.
The generated positions are processed through a backtracking algorithm to ensure their validity and solvability, offering a unique and challenging experience for users.
